## Vision

A Dapp designed for less experienced Web3 users to help them make better decisions on collateral management, enabling them to request loans on AAVE with optimal benefits.

## Description

With a single button, the user can obtain a list of the three best tokens recommended for use as collateral in the Aave Dapp. These options are presented clearly and are selectable, allowing the user to easily choose the most suitable token for collateralization.

Once the user has selected one of the recommended tokens, the Dapp provides a detailed explanation of the analysis behind that recommendation, presenting the information in an easy-to-understand text format. Additionally, a preconfigured option for the selected token is automatically enabled, allowing the user to deposit the collateral directly in an efficient and hassle-free manner.

This functionality not only simplifies the process of choosing collateral for less experienced Web3 users but also enhances their experience by ensuring they are using the most beneficial tokens available, thereby maximizing their opportunities to obtain loans with favorable conditions on Aave.
This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
```
